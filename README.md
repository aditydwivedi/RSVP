SQL - RSVP MOVIES CASE STUDY

I worked on this project as a data analyst ana an SQL expert.

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies.
They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.
The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data 
I had been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years.
I had to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that could help them start their new project.
